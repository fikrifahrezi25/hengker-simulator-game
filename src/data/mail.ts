Something is happening in Neo Satria City. People are disappearing. Scientists. Researchers. People who asked too many questions.

I've been watching the network traffic for months. There are packets going somewhere they shouldn't. Encrypted. Routed through nodes that don't officially exist.

I call it Project Eclipse.

If you want to know the truth — start with the Cyber Cafe on Meridian Street. Ask for Zara. Tell her the packet is missing.

She'll know what it means.

Be careful. They are watching.
